    "### Background and Project Goals\n",
    "A connected, functional floodplain retains water during periods of high flow and releases it back into the stream when flows are low. This process increases the resiliency and biodiversity of floodplain vegetation by providing a higher water table and thus longer, easier access to potentially limiting resources. Deposition by flooding events can increase water quality by 'dropping' harmful heavy metals or high nutrient loads onto the floodplain, keeping them from continuing downstream (2). Unfortunately, due to urban development and agriculture, floodplains can become disconnected from their source river. Reduced connectivity results in greater magnitude of flood events and vulnerability of surrounding ecosystems to drought.  Therefore, understanding connectivity can help guide water resource management and strengthen communities against natural disasters. \n",

    "\n",
    "Through this project, we aim to map floodplain connectivity at 5 target sites in the St. Vrain Basin in Boulder, CO and use the results to evaluate if desired watershed conditions are being met. We will also compare the results between UAV or LiDAR derived data, to see which performs better in terms of quantifying floodplain connectivity. Our aim is to create an open and reproducible workflow for The Watershed Center and other researchers to use for future analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "We will use two types of data:\n",
    "* UAV imagery (to process in Agisoft and create DTM), source: DJI Phantom 4, collected by contractor in Spring & Fall 2022\n",
    "* LiDAR data (downloaded as LAS and DTM), source: [Colorado Hazard Mapping, Airborne Snow Observatories](https://coloradohazardmapping.com/lidarDownload)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these datasets, we will create digital elevation models (DEM), and digital terrain models (DTM; DEM with vegetation removed) for each site using Agisoft Metashape Professional v1.8.5. We will then create relative elevation models for the five DTM's with two different methods: the first of which follows the watershed center's protocol relying on the Colorado Water Conservation Boardâ€™s REM Generator Tool in ArcMap, the second uses the RiverREM package to generate a relative elevation model for each site with each data source (UAV and LiDAR)\n",
    "\n",
    "Elevation models are a core component of modern-day floodplain mapping. High-accuracy DEM's are necessary to sufficiently predict how water will flood an area based on the surface slope and topography (3). Elevation models are digital grids with an elevation value assigned to each square; a low-resolution DEM has fewer and larger squares while a high-resolution DEM has many smaller square. REM's and DTM's (bare earth models) are derivative products from a DEM, so they'll all have the same resolution unless down-sampling occurs. For this reason, it's important to obtain a high-quality DEM before attempting any complex processing tasks in order to accurately predict flooding events and impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "![DEM grids](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0016706100000811-gr2.gif)\n",
    "*Img source: 4*\n",
    "\n",
    "Our end products include a REM and histogram for each of the 5 sites, created from both UAV- and LiDAR-derived data as well as a qualitative and quantitative comparison between the two data sources to suggest which method is best for The Watershed Center to use for future floodplain mapping. Ultimately, we hope to replicate the existing, software-reliant process using python tools to create an open and reproducible workflow for generating REM's.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This Notebook\n",
    "In this notebook, we plot the study sites and generate a preliminary REM using a pre-processed DTM from the Highway 93 site and the REMMaker function. Please ensure the [RiverREM package](https://github.com/OpenTopography/RiverREM) is downloaded on your computer before running the REMMaker tool, see the readme file for download instructions. The DTM was created by processing UAV-derived images in Agisoft (this step was completed by the Watershed Center). We loaded this DTM to a GitHub release to allow the user of this notebook to download it. We also provide a  shapefile of the centerline of the River at the study site, which was genereated in ArcGIS. \n",
