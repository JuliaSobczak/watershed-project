# Example Project Repository

Begining repository for Earth Analytics Certificate project - Julia and Lindsay's watershed project
For Final Project due next week we need to add project descrtiption, environement with RiverREM, and ipynb with code to download and plot 2 data sets (idea is to use hwy93 DTMs (either download from watershed center webpage? or uplaod to github) and plot with RiverREM)

## Project Description
What are goals, methods? Message Box, etc.

## Collaborators and Acknowledgements

## Use zenodo to create persistent url (doi), can also upload data but file size may be too large (50MB max)
etc.

## Environment Requirements
How to install your environment
  * Start with instructions for installing the ea-python environment (see - https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/setup-python-conda-earth-analytics-environment/)
  *  Include code for installing additional packages, e.g.:

  ```bash
  conda install h5py
  ```
  
  * OR make your own environment.ymp file based on the earth analytics python one (e.g., edit existing file to add new packages, remove packages not needed); test first

## Data Access
Complete instrucitons for accesing enough data to run the workflow.
  * Working urls
  * if url points at a web form, you must have complete info on what to put there
  * If possible, you should host dta or data subset on github
  * * Data must include citations

> If you need to process raw data before sending it out, you can include a notebook or script for that, that I will not run.
> Include code to access 2 data sources and plot; if can't use the download, talk with Elsa for alternative
